ü§ñ AutoCollector WhatsApp Bot
A powerful and customizable WhatsApp bot designed to automate the collection of cards and Pok√©mon from specific game bots, featuring human-like behavior, robust management commands, and inventory tracking.
‚ú® Features
 * Automated Card & Pok√©mon Collection: Automatically detects and sends collection commands for specified game bots.
 * Human-like Behavior:
   * Randomized Delays: Uses random delays (3-6 seconds) before sending collection commands to mimic human response times.
   * Typing Indicator: Displays "typing..." presence before sending collection commands for added realism.
 * Configurable Auto-Collection:
   * Global enable/disable for both card and Pok√©mon auto-collection.
   * Group-specific enable/disable to fine-tune where the bot operates.
 * Manual Pok√©mon Catch: If the bot cannot identify a Pok√©mon from an image, it sends the image to the owner's DM for manual identification and allows a !catch command reply.
 * Collection Statistics: Tracks successful and failed collection attempts.
 * Owner-Only Commands: Critical management commands are restricted to the bot owner.
 * Bot Management: Commands to change bot mode (public/private), restart, or shut down the bot.
 * Inventory Management: Lists collected cards and Pok√©mon, and allows clearing the inventory.
 * JID Extraction: A utility command to easily get the JID of a quoted message sender.
 * Test Message Sending: A safeguarded command to send a specified number of test messages to a target with a configurable delay.
 * Persistent Settings: Bot settings, inventory, and collection statistics are saved to files and persist across restarts.
 * Pop-up Prevention: Aggressively prevents the "This message will not disappear from the chat" pop-up.
 * Extensible Plugin System: Easily add new custom commands by creating files in the plugins/commands directory.
‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
 * Node.js: Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from nodejs.org.
 * npm: Node Package Manager, which comes with Node.js.
 * A WhatsApp Account: This will be the account your bot uses. It's recommended to use a dedicated number.
üöÄ Installation
Follow these steps to get your bot up and running:
 * Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/notyourtaha/Auto-Claim-Back-up-.git
cd Auto-Claim-Back-up-.git

 * Install Dependencies:
   npm install
# Ensure Baileys is up-to-date
npm install @whiskeysockets/baileys@latest

 * Create config.cjs:
   Create a file named config.cjs in the root directory of your bot (same level as index.cjs) and add the following content. Make sure to replace 923004204338 with your actual WhatsApp number (without + or spaces).
   // config.cjs
module.exports = {
  // Your WhatsApp number without any leading '+' or spaces.
  ownerNumber: '923004204338', 

  // Bot's operational mode:
  // 'private': Only the owner can use commands and receive notifications.
  // 'public': Everyone can use commands (auto-collector enable/disable remains owner-only).
  mode: 'private', // Initial mode. Can be changed via !setmode command.

  // Array of WhatsApp JIDs (numbers) of the bots your bot should specifically monitor for cards.
  // Set to the JID(s) of your card/Pok√©mon spawn bots.
  monitoredBotNumbers: [
    '919410207027@s.whatsapp.net', // Example JID
    '2348163376700@s.whatsapp.net', // Example JID
    '18765468192@s.whatsapp.net',   // Example JID
  ],

  // Array of WhatsApp JIDs (numbers) of the bots your bot should specifically monitor for Pok√©mon spawns.
  // Set to the JID(s) of your card/Pok√©mon spawn bots.
  monitoredPokemonBotNumbers: [
    '919410207027@s.whatsapp.net', // Example JID
    '2348163376700@s.whatsapp.net', // Example JID
    '18765468192@s.whatsapp.net',   // Example JID
  ],

  // Collection delay ranges in milliseconds for human-like behavior
  collectionDelays: {
    initial: { // Delay before sending the first collection command for a spawn
      min: 3000, // Minimum 3 seconds
      max: 6000  // Maximum 6 seconds
    },
    interGroup: { // Delay between sending collection commands to different groups if multiple spawns
      min: 1000, // Minimum 1 second
      max: 2000  // Maximum 2 seconds
    }
  }
};

 * Initial Run & QR Code Scan:
   The first time you run the bot, it will generate a QR code in your terminal.
   node index.cjs

   Scan this QR code using your WhatsApp app (WhatsApp Settings -> Linked Devices -> Link a Device).
   A session_dir folder will be created to store your session data. Do not delete this folder unless you want to re-authenticate.
 * Enable Auto-Collectors:
   After the bot connects and sends you an "Online" message in your DM, you must enable the auto-collectors:
   * To enable global card auto-collection, send !œÄ .. to the bot in your DM.
   * To enable global Pok√©mon auto-collection, send !‚àö .. to the bot in your DM.
   * You will receive confirmation messages.
üèÉ Running the Bot
Once installed and configured:
 * To run in the foreground (for testing):
   node index.cjs

   Close the terminal window to stop the bot.
 * To run in the background (recommended for production):
   Use a process manager like PM2.
   * Install PM2 globally: npm install -g pm2
   * Start the bot with PM2: pm2 start index.cjs --name autocollector-bot
   * Save PM2 configuration (to auto-start on reboot): pm2 save
   * To view logs: pm2 logs autocollector-bot
   * To stop: pm2 stop autocollector-bot
   * To restart: pm2 restart autocollector-bot
üí¨ Bot Commands
All commands start with !. Commands marked "(Owner only)" can only be used by the ownerNumber defined in config.cjs.

üîå Extending the Bot (Plugins)
The bot is designed to be extensible through a simple plugin system for commands.
 * Create plugins/commands Directory:
   Ensure you have a folder named plugins in your bot's root directory, and inside it, a folder named commands.
   your-bot-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.cjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.cjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myNewCommand.cjs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

 * Create a Command File:
   Inside plugins/commands/, create a new JavaScript file (e.g., myNewCommand.cjs).
 * Command Structure:
   Each command file should export an object with at least pattern and run properties:
   // plugins/commands/myNewCommand.cjs
module.exports = {
    pattern: '!mycommand', // The command trigger (e.g., '!hello', '!greet <name>')
    description: 'A brief description of what this command does.', // Optional: for !help
    async run(sock, msg, config, helpers) {
        // sock: The Baileys socket instance (for sending messages)
        // msg: The full message object that triggered the command
        // config: Your bot's config.cjs content
        // helpers: An object containing useful functions and bot state:
        //   - isAutoCollectorEnabledForChat(jid)
        //   - isPokemonAutoCollectorEnabledForChat(jid)
        //   - setAutoCollectorGlobal(boolean)
        //   - setGroupAutoCollector(jid, boolean)
        //   - setPokemonAutoCollectorGlobal(boolean)
        //   - setGroupPokemonAutoCollector(jid, boolean)
        //   - getBotMode()
        //   - setBotMode(mode)
        //   - isOwner (boolean)
        //   - isGroup (boolean)
        //   - sendToOwner(messageContent) (sends message to owner DM)
        //   - getUptime()
        //   - collectedCards (array of collected cards)
        //   - addCardToInventory(cardDetails)
        //   - saveInventory()
        //   - collectedPokemon (array of collected Pok√©mon)
        //   - addPokemonToInventory(pokemonDetails)
        //   - savePokemonInventory()
        //   - logActivity(level, message) (for logging to console and file)

        const { from, sender, isGroup, isOwner } = msg.key;
        const commandText = helpers.extractMessageText(msg.message); // Helper to get command text

        if (!isOwner) {
            await helpers.sendToOwner(sock, { text: 'üö´ *Permission Denied!* You are not the bot owner.' });
            return;
        }

        await sock.sendMessage(from, { text: 'Hello from my custom command!' });
        console.log(`[DEBUG] Custom command !mycommand executed by ${sender}`);
    }
};

   Restart your bot after adding or modifying plugin files for changes to take effect.
‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
 * Bot not connecting / QR code issues:
   * Ensure your internet connection is stable.
   * Delete the session_dir folder and restart node index.cjs to generate a new QR code.
   * Make sure your WhatsApp app is updated to the latest version.
 * "This message will not disappear from the chat. The sender may be on an old version of WhatsApp." pop-up:
   * This issue has been addressed with ephemeralExpiration: 0 on outgoing messages. Ensure you are using the latest index.cjs provided. If it persists, it might be a client-side WhatsApp issue on your device.
 * Typing indicator (3 dots) not showing consistently:
   * Ensure you are using the latest index.cjs which has improved reliability for this.
   * Check your network connection; delays or dropped packets can affect presence updates.
 * Bot not responding to commands:
   * Verify the ownerNumber in config.cjs is correct (no + or spaces).
   * Check the bot's mode (!setmode public if you want non-owners to use general commands).
   * Ensure the command syntax is correct (e.g., !help, not help).
   * Check the console for any error messages.
 * Auto-collection not working:
   * Ensure global auto-collector is enabled (!œÄ .. or !‚àö ..).
   * If in a specific group, ensure auto-collector is enabled for that group (!œÄ . or !‚àö .).
   * Verify monitoredBotNumbers in config.cjs are correct JIDs of the game bots.
   * Check the console for "Card Auto-collector NOT triggered" or "Pok√©mon auto-collector NOT triggered" messages to understand why.
   * Ensure the bot is actually receiving messages from the game bot (check console logs).
 * !sendtestmessages not working as expected:
   * Ensure you are the owner.
   * Check the amount and delay parameters against the MAX_TEST_MESSAGES (200) and MIN_TEST_MESSAGE_DELAY (500ms) safeguards.
   * Verify the target JID is valid.
